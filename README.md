About Me
======

Hello! I am known as `sciwhiz12`. I am a hobbyist programmer, mostly working on stuff related to modded Minecraft. I am the current toolchain team lead and member of the reviewers team of [ParchmentMC][parchment], and a bot maintainer for [Minecraft Mod Development][mmd].

I was a former Triage team member and community moderator for Minecraft Forge, and formerly the head administrator on the [Forge Community Wiki][fcw].[^1]

I can be contacted through my email as listed on GitHub, or through Discord as `sciwhiz12` (I can be contacted through the [Minecraft Mod Development][mmd] [discord server][mmd_discord].)

If you appreciate my work and want to give something in return, you can [sponsor me on GitHub][gh-sponsors] or [tip me on Ko-fi][ko-fi]. Thanks, it means a lot to me!

Have a nice day!

[^1]: Unfortunately, I was forcibly removed from the team by unforunate circumstances involving grievances against the project leadership regarding the Code of Conduct, which prompted my resignation from the wiki staff team per a previously declared resolve to resign if I was forcibly removed.
