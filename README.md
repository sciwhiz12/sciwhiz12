About Me
======

Hello! I am known as `sciwhiz12`. I am a hobbyist programmer, mostly working on stuff related to [Minecraft Forge][forge] and mods made using Forge. I am also a Triage team member over at Minecraft Forge, an administrator on the [Forge Community Wiki][fcw], a bot maintainer for [Minecraft Mod Development][mmd], and the current toolchain team lead of [ParchmentMC][parchment].

I can be contacted through the email of `sciwhiz12@sciwhiz12.tk`, or through Discord as `sciwhiz12#1286` (I am usually active on The Forge Project [discord server][forge_discord] and on the [Minecraft Mod Development][mmd] [discord server][mmd_discord].)

Have a nice day!
